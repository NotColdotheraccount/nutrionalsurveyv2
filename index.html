    <p>Welcome!<br><br>
        <b><u>Participant Information and Consent<br><br></u></b>
        You are invited to take part in a short study about how people form impressions of food products. This study is part of the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons project in Behavioural Economics and Marketing by four bachelor students and is conducted purely for educational purposes. Participation takes about 4 minutes, and the survey is completely anonymous and voluntary, therefore you may stop at any time without penalty.
        Your responses will be kept secure and used only in aggregated form for analysis.
        By clicking “I consent”, you confirm that you are 18 or older and agree to take part.</p>
